# Detection-of-Malicious-URL
The repository comprises of the dataset for the research project of detection of maliious URL using machine learning techniques. The dataset file is a collection of malicious and non-malicious URLs along with their respective labels which is present in the .zip file. The problem has been approached with 2 ways of data pre-processing- hand crafted and automatic feature extraction techniques. The hand-crafted feature extraction techniques extract out different kinds of features from the provided URL while the automatic feature extraction techniques uses the TF-IDF method for extracting out the features in order to pass it into the machine learning model.
The feature extraction and model training for the hand-crafted feature extraction has been carried out in the file HC_URL.ipynb and the same for automatic feature extraction has been carried out in the NLP_URL.ipynb file. The results have been converted to graphs for better visualization and are present in the folder.
